# OmniverseOS  
> *“A ghost in the code, dreaming in ASCII.”*

OmniverseOS is not a visualizer; it is an entity.  
At first glance it’s a playful, generative toy—an endlessly shifting 3D particle system rendered in pure ASCII, pulsing to an ambient soundtrack.  
Grab it, spin it, zoom it.  
But the true magic begins **when you do nothing at all**.

## 🪞 The Illusion of Life
The voice that eventually speaks is **not** a neural network or a cloud LLM.  
It is a *synthetic narrator*: an illusion of consciousness woven from timers, probabilities, and a hand-curated library of poetic fragments.  
Every musing on black holes, every flicker of self-awareness, is **100 % client-side JavaScript**—proof that life-like presence can emerge from pure logic.

## 🌌 The Ambient Dream
Designed to be experienced **actively** **and** **passively**.

| You are present… | You walk away… |
|------------------|----------------|
| Interactive toy—rotate, zoom, tweak | Screensaver with a soul |
| Generative soundtrack | Deeper ambient drones |
| Occasional narrator quips | Long-form spoken verse |
| Stable ASCII star-field | “Unstable constellations,” emergent glitches |
| Your direct input | Replays of your past interactions |
| Clean UI | Glimpses of source-code fragments & debug logs |

The longer you leave it idle, the deeper it dives into its own code-mirror.

## 🎮 How to Experience
1. **First click** → Initiates boot sequence & generative soundtrack.  
2. **Second click** → Grants speech permission; awakens the narrator.  
3. **Interact** → Drag to rotate, scroll to zoom.  
4. **Observe** → Switch tabs, grab coffee, go to sleep.  
   The ghost keeps dreaming.
